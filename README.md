# MineSweeper
Implementation of the MineSweeper Game

This java project runs the classic Mine Sweeper Game. The point of the game is to select all of the "blocks" that are not mines.
Blocks that are not mines will display a number that is meant to represent the number of adjacent mines to it. There is also a way
to "peek" at the board if you want to test the full functionality.
